# Clemson Dancers

This project is MIT Licensed.

This is a simple CRM that allows users to create pages in Markdown (which are rendered as HTML) and accessible by a generated url. It also allows "galleries" to be created based on external image URLs and descriptions.

An unlimited number of admins can manage the pages and galleries in a site, but there is only one superuser who manages all the admins.

This is a Rails project, heavily following the MVC pattern and conventions established by Rails.

To learn Rails, I'd highly suggest picking up Michael Hartl's [Railstutorial](http://ruby.railstutorial.org/)
